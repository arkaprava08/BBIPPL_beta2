                                We, offer our services as EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) in installing solar PV based power generation units in various parts of India. We erect, install, commission and operate solar REC project primarily in radiation rich part of Rajasthan.
                                We ensure the project enters into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the local Distribution Company (DISCOM) in Rajasthan. The PPA is signed at the Average Pooled Purchase Cost of power paid by the DISCOM. RECs are availed over and above the PPA. We target an average of 17,000 units per MW per annum. This will also help the solar REC supply in the market. Solar RECs are currently trading close to the forbearing price of INR 13,400 per REC or Rs. 9 per unit. Even Carbon credit is also earned.
                                Brick and byte is offering turnkey solution across the solar energy sector, providing high end project management services along with design & engineering, supply, installation, testing & commissioning.
                                Solar EPC Business unit is operated by a highly experienced team of professionals having long & rich experience in the Industry in various facets of discipline viz.

                                The EPC group has a very wide range of portfolio covering the entire gamut of the Life cycle of Industrial Plants as a Turnkey Project executing agency in various fields.
                                High return on investment in minimal possible time is our area of expertise.
                                We set up a MW level Grid Interactive Free Field Power Plant based on Solar Photovoltaic power plant of either 1 MW or 5 MW or 10 MW under Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Scheme. Under this scheme Power Purchase Agreement is signed by State discom and the same is valid for 25 years or it can be sold to third party under open licensing policy available in certain states.
