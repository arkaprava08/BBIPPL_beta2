                                    Intelligent Building Management Systems (iBMS) are centralized, interlinked, networks of hardware and software, which monitor and control the environment in commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities. While managing various building systems, the automation system ensures the operational performance of the facility as well as the comfort and safety of building occupants.

                                    Automation helps you compete better by allowing you to increase productivity, flexibility and quality. By automating repetitive manual tasks, your workers can perform more specialized tasks, providing you with better productivity and, in some cases, opportunities to expand your product offering. Automation also helps reduce or eliminate human error, which in turn reduces the cost of error recovery and increases the overall quality of your product.

                                    Public Address (PA) Systems play a vital role in crisis management and co-coordinating response actions during an emergency situation. This is more so if the crisis occurs in a public place, crowded areas, markets, railway stations, offices, hotels etc. The central control room staff can use PA systems effectively for conveying instructions on emergency and evacuation procedures that need to be followed. They are important for crowd management and aid in directing people to safety.
