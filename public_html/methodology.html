                                            Activities during the software development life cycle (SDLC), which involve 
                                            extensive interaction with the user, are usually provided on-site at the customer's 
                                            location. However, after the function or design specifications are made clear, 
                                            the activities are typically moved offshore. Acceptance Testing and Implementation 
                                            of the systems are done at client's site.

                                            Establishing an Online Quality Management System has been the first of 
                                            such steps to ensure a process-centric approach within the organization.
                                            The processes are implemented and the feedback from the implementation is 
                                            used to ensure a continuous improvement framework. In Brick and Byte, the 
                                            Quality Practice has an internal support group known as Software Quality Assurance 
                                            (SQA) which takes care of the software Quality assurance activities in the projects.
                                            Under the guidance of senior Quality Leaders, SQAs are deputed to each project. 
                                            They work with the projects and facilitate the implementation of the Quality 
                                            Management System.

                                            The Process Asset Library is maintained and managed by the Process Champions 
                                            called SEPG. Quality initiatives like these strengthen Brick and Byte’s commitment

                                            Agile development methodology provides opportunities to assess 
                                            the direction of a project throughout the development lifecycle. 
                                            This is achieved through regular cadences of work, known as sprints
                                            or iterations, at the end of which teams must present a potentially
                                            shippable product increment. By focusing on the repetition of abbreviated 
                                            work cycles as well as the functional product they yield, agile methodology 
                                            is described as "iterative" and "incremental." In waterfall, development teams 
                                            only have one chance to get each aspect of a project right. In an agile paradigm,
                                            every aspect of development — requirements, design, etc. — is continually 
                                            revisited throughout the lifecycle. When a team stops and re-evaluates the 
                                            direction of a project every two weeks, there’s always time to steer it in
                                            another direction. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The results of this "inspect-and-adapt" approach to development greatly 
                                            reduce both development costs and time to market. Because teams can develop
                                            software at the same time they’re gathering requirements, the phenomenon known 
                                            as "analysis paralysis" is less likely to impede a team from making progress. 
                                            And because a team’s work cycle is limited to two weeks, it gives stakeholders 
                                            recurring opportunities to calibrate releases for success in the real world. 
                                            Agile development methodology helps companies build the right product. Instead 
                                            of committing to market a piece of software that hasn’t even been written yet, 
                                            agile empowers teams to continuously replan their release to optimize its value
                                            throughout development, allowing them to be as competitive as possible in the 
                                            marketplace. Development using an agile methodology preserves a product’s critical
                                            market relevance and ensures a team’s work doesn’t wind up on a shelf, never released.
