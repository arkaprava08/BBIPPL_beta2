                                    J2EE technology evolves through community process and is a very popular open source platform. It provides standards and mechanisms for the 3 basic layers of a typical web application - presentation layer, business logic layer and data access layer. It provides for asynchronous communication, mail API, and security as well. It tries to restrict itself to provide standards and leave it to tool providers to implement these standards. The tool provider then customizes it for the end developer. This greatly simplifies the developer's job and allows customer to choose the tool, which suits them most.
