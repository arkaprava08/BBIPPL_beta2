                                Smaller, faster and smarter - these words define the embedded software development. With rapid technology advancements hardware is getting smaller and faster. Software has to rapidly adapt to deliver more and more innovative, secure and reliable solutions based on state of the art hardware. In order to keep pace with the technology advancements and changing business needs, new solutions need to have minimal time-to-market and existing solutions need to be migrated within short timelines. This necessitates the need for a partner who has extensive embedded software development experience of evolving new solutions as well as migration and support of existing ones. At BBIPPL. We have the right embedded technology expertise of developing and testing high quality solutions in short development / migration cycles which enables our clients to get the best ROI.

                                    A well executed design and development cycle for an electronic product requires travel through many stages before arriving at a successful conclusion. Here are the stages that we have determined are needed to create a well designed electronic product. 
                                </p>

This stage of research must result in a detailed design specification that is used to cost the design process that follows as well as the estimated manufactured cost of the product. The agency compliance requirements (U.L., F.C.C., C.E., etc.) are defined now.

                                    This is the stage where the device under design gets a suitable enclosure designed or selected. This enclosure selection as well as connectors, controls, and displays must all be resolved before the printed circuit layout commences. The first step in designing printed circuits the mechanical pattern or outline of the board assembly itself.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The major steps in this process are: <br>
                                    •	A package (housing) is selected or designed. If designed, the mechanical drawing must be produced of the assembly. If selected, this drawing will be supplied by the manufacturer. <br>
                                    •	Nomenclature and graphics for the enclosure will be designed. This may be applied in the form of labels, overlays, silk-screens, or a combination.<br>
                                    •	The printed circuit layout commences and resolves the requirements of the circuit diagram usage of electronic components with the form factor demanded by the packaging design process.<br>
                                    •	The printed circuit artwork is processed on film and used by a manufacturer to etch printed circuit boards for the board assembler. A silkscreen of part locations to assist in the assembly process is normally applied on the printed circuit card by the manufacturer.<br>
                                </p>

                                    Sometimes prototypes are built before stage 4 (packaging and printed circuit layout) but the speed and cost advantages of computer aided design are making this more uncommon. A hand-wired prototype of all or a portion of the circuit may be required for the design process.

                                    Designed for specific control functions, stand-alone and part of a larger system, embedded system designs are popular for its real-time computing constraints. We design software for embedded system devices and specialized in real time computing. Most of the old embedded software is migrated from custom-built to standard RTOS's. The impact of advancement in this area can be seen in all verticals - Automotive, Medical, Industrial Controls, Aerospace, Telecom / Datacom and Consumer Electronics. We work with leading RTOS's vendors in this space to deliver high quality and innovative solutions to embedded products.
