                                Intelligent Transport System (ITS) is designed for the urban / state / private road transport organizations (public and private RTCs). The system consists of a backend and a hardware component to provide an integrated solution for the driver console unit, electronic ticking machine, passenger information system and vehicle tracking system. ITS provides a single solution for transport companies to schedule and monitor buses with the help of advance technologies such as GPS, Wi-Fi and GPRS
                                The Need Road transport organizations typically have huge fleet of buses that operate from depots situated at remote locations. With the increase in population the public transport organizations need to improve their services to provide better facilities. Without having an intelligent transport system in place, it is very difficult to improve the service. ITS will enable the transport organization to get the required bus, schedule, route and passenger information very quickly to execute public queries in a very efficient manner. With the help of Vehicle Tracking System, people can get the current location of the bus without communicating with the staff members. The electronic ticketing machine stores information of each and every ticket issued to the passengers. This ticketing data is used for managerial decisions such as introducing new bus routes or allocating part-time buses to operate at crowded locations. To have a better up-time for bus, ITS provides a driver console to monitor the bus 'health'. With the increase in terrorist attacks, public security is critical. ITS also provides security cameras which record the audio and video inside the bus.

                                Brick and Byte has AVC system which can be used for vehicle classification. It uses profiler to get the vehicle profile and classify the same accordingly. It comprises of Infrared transmitter on one side of the lane and receiver on the other side of the lane, forming a light curtain. As the vehicle passed through the curtain it cuts the infra rays and that helps in creating the vehicle profile / image. The image analyzer software then displays the image on screen and analyzes the same to let the vehicle class. Typical classification is – two wheelers, three wheeler, car/jeep/van, LCV, Truck/But, MAV. A typical setup is as shown in the diagram below:

                                The Lane Controller implements the complete functionality of the toll collection system at the lane level. It provides all the functionalities needed to process transactions whether it’s manual or ETC-based or smart-card-based. It receives data from the external lane equipment, processes them and generates outputs to the other equipment and sends data to the toll plaza server. It is also capable of storing transactions in its own hard disk so in case there is a failure in the LAN or the server, no transactions are lost.
                                Toll Terminal Equipment 
                                Video Display Unit 
                                This is the main toll teller graphical and text interface. It displays the teller prompts, choices, status of transaction and alarm messages. It shall also show what is being displayed on the Smart Card Reader LCD, if there is one.
                                Keyboard
                                This is an industrial grade keyboard where the toll teller enters the choice of operation, the vehicle class and the payment confirmation. Other functions such as manual override, teller login and logout and supervisor override are also done on the keyboard. 
                                Receipt/Ticket Printer
                                This is a dot matrix printer for printing receipts after every transaction and also for printing summaries at the end of each job.
                                CONTACTLESS SMART CARD READER
                                Motorists using smart cards for payment shall present their card to the Contactless Smart Card Reader which is mounted on the wall of the toll booth. The reader has an LCD display that shows whether the card is valid or there is insufficient balance. The actual balance on the card is also displayed.
                                LANE TRAFFIC LIGHT 
                                The lane traffic light signals the motorist to stop (red) or go (green). When the motorist approaches the toll booth, the traffic light signals a red. Once he has paid, the light turns to green and returns to red once the motorist has passed and the barrier has closed. The yellow light is an optional signal for applications such as stored value cards. It can serve as a warning if the balance in the card is below the minimum.
                                The main function of lane application is to handle payment transactions at the toll booth. Accept manual vehicle classification. Accept Destination. Accept method of payment. If smart card, read and validate smart card for balance and expiry date. If Cash, accept cash. If daily/return pass, read and validate barcode. Print receipt.
