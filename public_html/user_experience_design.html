                                    It is very important to practice usability in order to get a feedback of design in User Experience. The feedback allows you to go back and reﬁne part of the design to achieve ease of use. We perform all activities under our highly equipped lab. 
                                    Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the ﬁrst time they encounter the design? 
                                    Efficiency: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks? 
                                    Memorability: When users return to the design a_er a period of not using it, how easily can they re establish proﬁciency? Errors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors? 
                                    SaCsfacCon: How pleasant is it to use the design?

                                Information design is the practice of presenting information in a way that fosters eﬃcient and eﬀective understanding of it. The term has come to be used speciﬁcally for graphic design for displaying information eﬀectively, rather than just abractively or for artistic expression. Today, information design is closely related to the ﬁeld of data visualization.
