                                    Brick & Byte has developed Data Concentrator Units intended for data acquisition, transmission and storage of metering data from consumer meters to data center, on request or by push mechanism.
                                    The DCU is suited for installation in medium voltage (MV) / low voltage (LV) transformer stations as well as at the customer premises.
                                    It has numerous plug-in options for connecting meters at the downstream end (LV Power-line carrier (PLC) modem / Low power Radio modem / Serial RS232/485 port). Cellular modem (GPRS/CDMA/PSTN/WIMAX) and Wide Area Network (via Ethernet/ VSAT) are the options available for upstream communication to central system.

                                    The data concentrator can read meters from pre-loaded and programmable schedules or from spontaneous tasks, initiated by central system. It can record daily billing data, hourly/daily profile values and events and store locally for periodic / ad-hoc transmission to the central system. The metering DCU can poll data cyclically on a pre-programmed interval or on ad-hoc basis for on-demand/demand scan. This is Smart-Grid ready and supports bidirectional communication for AMI and Demand Response applications, as well as supporting remote configuration and upgrade.

                                    Data concentrator unit is a micro controller based device which has dual communication capabilities Viz. GPRS and LPR. DCU is designed to collect the data from Meter Interface Unit over Low Power Radio and transfer the data further to the central server using GPRS. It has been within built power supply which can withstand surges up to 6 KV and also has rechargeable Li-ion battery.
