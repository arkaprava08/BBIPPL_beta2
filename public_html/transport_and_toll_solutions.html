                                    Intelligent Transport System (ITS) is designed for the urban / state / private road transport organizations (public and private RTCs). The system consists of a backend and a hardware component to provide an integrated solution for the driver console unit, electronic ticking machine, passenger information system and vehicle tracking system. ITS provides a single solution for transport companies to schedule and monitor buses with the help of advance technologies such as GPS, Wi-Fi and GPRS
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Need Road transport organizations typically have huge fleet of buses that operate from depots situated at remote locations. With the increase in population the public transport organizations need to improve their services to provide better facilities. Without having an intelligent transport system in place, it is very difficult to improve the service. ITS will enable the transport organization to get the required bus, schedule, route and passenger information very quickly to execute public queries in a very efficient manner. With the help of Vehicle Tracking System, people can get the current location of the bus without communicating with the staff members. The electronic ticketing machine stores information of each and every ticket issued to the passengers. This ticketing data is used for managerial decisions such as introducing new bus routes or allocating part-time buses to operate at crowded locations. To have a better up-time for bus, ITS provides a driver console to monitor the bus 'health'. With the increase in terrorist attacks, public security is critical. ITS also provides security cameras which record the audio and video inside the bus.

                                    Brick and Byte has AVC system which can be used for vehicle classification. It uses profiler to get the vehicle profile and classify the same accordingly. It comprises of Infrared transmitter on one side of the lane and receiver on the other side of the lane, forming a light curtain. As the vehicle passed through the curtain it cuts the infra rays and that helps in creating the vehicle profile / image. The image analyzer software then displays the image on screen and analyzes the same to let the vehicle class. Typical classification is – two wheelers, three wheeler, car/jeep/van, LCV, Truck/But, MAV. A typical setup is as shown in the diagram below:
