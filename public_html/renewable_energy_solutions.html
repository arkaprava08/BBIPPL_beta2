                                Brick and Byte has developed indigenous technologies in the space of clean and green energy, particularly solar and solar energy related initiative by a group of eminent and experienced scientists and entrepreneurs. The emphasis was on mastering core technologies, fundamentally sound designs based upon simulation and experimental data, and keeping commercial goals in mind. By putting in 4 - 5 years of dedicated efforts, B&B developed a design breakthrough technology as its first achievement , viz. Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR) platform based on Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and takes pride in being the first developer of indigenous solar energy technologies and its applications.
                                The initial thrust of development was producing steam at high temperatures and pressure suitable for electrical power generation. On achieving this, special designs were developed for steam generation that is compatible to solar cooling mechanisms.

                                We have close tie up with leaders in the cooling technology - Thermax. Our systems are matched to produce heat energy for VAM (Vapor Absorption Machine) units. This VAM technology is utilizes Lithium Bromide solution.
                                The indigenous development of technology is under various stages of patent filing and approval.

                                Photovoltaic (PV) panels are often used for agricultural operations, especially in remote areas or where the use of an alternative energy source is desired. In particular, they have been demonstrated time and time again to reliably produce sufficient electricity directly from solar radiation (sunlight) to power livestock and irrigation watering systems.
                                A benefit of using solar energy to power agricultural water pump systems is that increased water requirements for livestock and irrigation tend to coincide with the seasonal increase of incoming solar energy. When properly designed, these PV systems can also result in significant long-term cost savings and a smaller environmental footprint compared to conventional power systems.

                                The volume of water pumped by a solar- powered system in a given interval depends on the total amount of solar energy available in that time period. Specifically, the flow rate of the water pumped is determined by both the intensity of the solar energy available and the size of the PV array used to convert that solar energy into direct current (DC) electricity.
                                Even existing Pumps can be retrofitted for solar compatibility.
