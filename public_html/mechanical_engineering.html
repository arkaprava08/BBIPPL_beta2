These are implemented as per our customer requirements and BBIPPL shall follow SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) phases and keeping future customer’s future roadmap in mind. The following are typical Design Automation areas but not limited to,

                                    In order to reduce time to Market and to deduce design decisions at early stages of product development, all OEMs and product suppliers apply reverse engineering techniques. Creation and Collection of cloud of points from existing physical parts, Design Optimization through existing product model, Material characterizations and re-material analysis and recommendations are few areas BBIPPL involved currently.

                                    Thanks to the advent of technologies and software packages, simulating Machining Processes and Manufacturing sequence are a key function in which all OEMs and Product Development Tier1, Tier2 companies are following. This brings very quick business decisions and avoids very costly rework efforts and delays in product development life cycle. There are popular software packages available in the market and BBIPPL has experience in taking up IT support on Digital Manufacturing areas.

                                    PLM plays a vital role in discrete product development / manufacturing sector and through this OEMs can manage its products from concept to delivery and even the after sales market. Software companies propagate managing products from cradle-to-graveyard through its software solutions. Recently, the retail market has also taken PLM as a vehicle to manage its various and dynamic product requirements and managements. BBIPPL has expertise in popular PLM packages like Teamcenter, Enovia and Windchill.

                                    Similar to PLM, currently OEMs and software solutions developers are bringing this concept in order to manage Virtual Simulation related functions like Finite Element Analysis and its different versions of results and design optimization status in correlation with CAD design maturity. Where PLM once addressed only CAD data, resulted in disconnect between Design Maturity and its corresponding Analysis data and caused hefty rework costs and delay in product development, this is no longer the case.
