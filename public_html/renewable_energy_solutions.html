                                    Brick and Byte has developed indigenous technologies in the space of clean and green energy, particularly solar and solar energy related initiative by a group of eminent and experienced scientists and entrepreneurs. 
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The emphasis was on mastering core technologies, fundamentally sound designs based upon simulation and experimental data, and keeping commercial goals in mind.</li>
                                    <li>By putting in 4 - 5 years of dedicated efforts, Brick and Byte developed a design breakthrough technology as its first achievement, viz. Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR) platform based on Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and demonstrated it in Osmanabad by generating steam of desired temperature and pressure.</li>
                                    <li>It is Pride in being the first developer of indigenous solar energy technologies and its applications.</li>
                                    <li>Patent for this indigenous developed technology filed and is under progress.</li>
                                    <li>This system is matched to produce heat energy for VAM (Vapour Absorption Machine) units. This VAM technology is utilizes Lithium Bromide solution. We have close tie up with leaders in the cooling technology.</li>
                                    <li>The initial thrust of development was producing steam at high temperatures and pressure suitable for electrical power generation. On achieving this, special designs were developed for steam generation that is compatible to solar cooling mechanisms.</li>

                                    <img src="images/renewable_energy/2.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <li>Though current plant was installed for technology demonstration, it can be very easily engineered for custom requirements and achieve the desired robustness.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><u>Partnership with the State Government: </u>
                                            It is well established that availability of cold storage units at village level is the missing link for efficient supply chain of fruits and vegetables. As a result, almost 30 to 40 % of the produce perishes before reaching the customer. Solar energy based cold storage. Many state governments are looking for solution to solve the above problem. It may be possible to approach farmers associations and National Horticulture Mission to set up cold storage plants based on Solar Thermal energy. B&B would be happy to partner in such a venture as Technology Partner to provide IT enabled Solar Thermal platform.</li>
                                    <li><u>Partnership with Private Companies: </u>
                                    Many private companies are showing interest to purchase power instead of setting up plants. Some of them are willing to consider setting up captive power plants based on Solar Thermal technology. We would explore OPEN ACCESS license to set up power generation plant in Osmanabad and sell electricity to customers in any other state through the grid. If customer indicates power purchase rate and his interest specifically in solar energy based power, we would conduct feasibility study and indicate if it would be possible to provide power at the desired rate.</li>
                                    <li><u>Solar Thermal energy for energy efficiency in processing industry:  </u>
                                    Processing industry management is getting energy audit done to take steps towards energy efficient operation of their plants. The energy auditors would be aware how energy efficiency could be achieved and can very well relate value of solar thermal plant for such industries. It would be worth exploring the partnership with Energy Auditors.</li>
